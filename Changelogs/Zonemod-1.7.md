* **Spawn Rotation**
  * The Spawns are fixed and the rotation will work as intended now.
    * As fun as the Quads were, it was unintended.

  * Spawntimers have been decreased by **1** second. (**14 Seconds now**)

* **Charger:**
  * Punch Damage increased to **8**. (was **6**)
  * The Charger's first Punch will do **5** Damage.
    * As requested, the Charger can now easily bash people to death again.

With the introduction of **v1.7** this Config/Github will feature update packs which you can just drag and drop into your Server on top of the previous edition.  
These updates will only contain crucial files, which makes it a lot less likely to mess up your personal adjustments.  
Always make sure to double check though! :smile:
