# **Zonemod v1.7.1** 

### **[Bug Fixes]:**

---

* **Spawn Rotation**
  * Fixed a Bug that would cause non-full Infected Teams constantly getting stuck with at least one Support SI on every hit.

---

### **[Infected]:**

---

* **Tank:**
  * You will now lose Frustration **1.2s** after losing LOS of the Survivors. (was **1.5s**)
	* With Tanks losing Frustration faster after losing LOS, the Frustration bar will start blinking earlier on to notify you that you need to do something about it.
  * Keeping LOS of the Survivors will fill your rage bar (can't go past that Control's rage.)
    * As compensation for the Quick Frustration loss, Tanks will now be rewarded for keeping LOS (Gain 5% for every 4 Seconds of LOS Held)
	* Keep in mind that is a complete Alpha test, the Plugin is fully functional but its effectiveness and impact hasn't been tested in real gameplay.

---

### **[Weapons]:**

---

* **Melee:**
  * Melee Weapons have now been removed from the Saferoom.
  * Melee Weapon Limit of **2** has been set. (**1** for 2v2 and **No Limit** for 1v1)
	* Melee Damage on Tank has been reset to it's Vanilla value to balance these Nerfs.
