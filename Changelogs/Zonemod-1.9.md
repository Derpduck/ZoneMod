# **Zonemod v1.9**

---

### **[Bug/Exploit Fixes]:**

---

* Fixed a lagspike that occurs when switching to the other team when a round ends, this resolves invisible players on the first hit.
* Fixed an Exploit that allowed you to duplicate Survivors and or ruin entire games by simply picking a character that was already taken with a console command.

* **Deathcam:**
  * Players that try to bypass the Death Cam by spectating and switching back will be prevented from joining back for a few seconds.
    * These players will be moved back onto the team automatically.

* **Charger:**
  * Fixed other SI being able to freeze the Charger mid-charge by attacking the same target.
  * Fixed other SI being able to target a Survivor that is about to get pummeled after a Charge.
	* Not only were these bugs annoying for both Infected and Survivors, they also allowed for a potential server crash.

### **[Maps]:**

* **General:**
  * Cleaned up the Maps from Junk Props that you could get stuck on, allowing for smoother movement.
  
* **Dead Air:**
  * Map 3:
	* Fixed Players getting stuck on the infamous "Klorain" Bottle after the Crescendo Event.

* **Death Toll:**
  * Map 1:
    * Fixed a few errors within the Stripper:Source file.
    * Added a block for an "Under the Map" Exploit.
      * Big Thanks to Midnight on this one. :smile:

### **[Survivors]:**

---

* **Shoves/M2:**
  * Survivors now get fatigued after **3** Shoves. (was **5**)
  * Shoving a Jockey/Smoker will add a penalty of **1**. (Meaning a Shove counts as **2** Shoves)

---

### **[Infected]:**

---

* **General:**
  * Spawn Timers have been set to **15**. (was **13**)
  
* **Deathcam:**
  * You will be moved to your "Killer" 1st person view, from here on you can switch between other players or change viewmode to 3rd person.
	* Freelook has to be remain disabled as enabling it would make you able to skip the death cam.

* **Hunter:**
  * Hunters can no longer Wallkick in **2v2**.

* **Smoker:**
  * Tongue will now recharge within **13**s after a successful hit (was **15**)
  * Tongue will now recharge at a slightly slower rate when insta-cleared, rewarding Survivors for their clear properly.
	* Insta-clears have never felt very rewarding, this change gives Survivors a bit more breathing room.
	* As we're rewarding Survivors, we might as well reward Smokers on successful pulls!

* **Tank:**
  * Tank HP has been set back to **6000** in **4v4.**
  * Slowdown has been removed.
  * Tank Speed has been set back to **200**. (was **220**)
