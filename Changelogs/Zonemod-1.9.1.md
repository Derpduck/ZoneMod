# **Zonemod v1.9.1**

---

### **[Bug/Exploit Fixes]:**

---

* Fixed an issue on Parish Map 2 where sometimes teams would be unable to open the front door of the Event Trailer, causing them to be stuck inside.
  * The back door will now be opened when the Event actually starts.

### **[Infected]:**

---
  
* **Deathcam:**
  * Movement is unlocked, so you can move around freely if you switch to Free Roam in your Death Cam.
    * This means that you can now shorten your "Death Cam" by simply moving around again. 
    * Spectating to try and skip your Death Cam entirely will get you a rejoin penalty of **6** Seconds.
