# **ZoneMod v1.5.1**

### **[Bugs / Exploits]:**

---

* Fixed Cars doing 6 damage a hit rather than 24 on Parish Map 5, caused by an outdated plugin. 
* Rewrote NoDeathCamSkip:
  * There's no way to skip the Death Cam now by pressing buttons and such.
    * During testing it showed that you could bypass the old deathcamskip with other keypresses as well (Zoom, Use, Duck, etc)

### **[Map Changes]:**

---

* **Hard Rain**:
  * *Map 2*:
    * Blocked Shortcut up the pipe to skip Ramp Choke.
  * *Map 3*: 
    * Blocked Shortcut up the pipe to skip Ramp Choke.
