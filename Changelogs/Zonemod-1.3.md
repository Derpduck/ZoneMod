# **Zonemod v1.3**

### **[Bugs / Exploits]:**

---

* Fixed Survivors being able to "self-clear" after being Jockeyed.
* Fixed the Tank freezing up if a player controlling the Tank switched team/disconnected during the Death Animation, which would cause one player on the Infected team to become stuck.

---

### **[Infected]:**

---

* Updated Horde Equaliser to allow for "Horde-pausing" on certain maps rather than having to choose between all maps or none.
  * Dead Center Map 4 Horde will pause whilst a Tank is up (this does not affect boomer horde)

---
